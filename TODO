add a clone method,  to make is Forward compatible to PHP5
-- need to test PHP5

the principle is that this code (which is common with DB_DataObject usage), will probably break

$person = new DataObject_Person;
$people = array();
$person->find();
while ($person->fetch()) {
	$people[] = $person;
}


will probably have to change to 


$person = new DataObject_Person;
$people = array();
$person->find();
while ($person->fetch()) {
	$people[] = $person->clone();
}


clone method will probably look something like this.

funtion clone() {
	if (phpversion() < 5) {
		return $this;
	}
	return $this->__clone();
}
